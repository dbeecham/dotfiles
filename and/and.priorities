# Sample priority database for the auto-nice daemon, /etc/and.priorities
#
# Comments must have the # in the _first_ column!
#
# File format:
#    user group job parent nice1 nice2 nice3
# - user: user name or user id or * for all
# - group: group name or group id or * for all
# - job: executable (without path; may be a regexp) or * for all
# - parent: keyword "parent=" or "ancestor=" followed by the 
#   executable (without path; may be a regexp), or * for all
# - nice1, nice2, nice3: nice levels for CPU usage ranges.
#
# At least one of user or group must be an asterisk *.
#
# After /etc/and.conf:lv1time seconds matching jobs are niced to nice1,
# after /etc/and.conf:lv2time to nice2 and after /etc/and.conf:lv3time
# to nice3.
#
# Read and.priorities(5) for details.

# Philosophy:
#
# Hold down notorious troublemakers (Netscape, colourful screensavers, ...)
# and leave other jobs alone. (Within reason, that is.)
# Note that a perceptive user might rename his jobs' executables to
# obtain higher privilegue. So the values must be sensible to that.
# For instance, noone with his mind right would rename his computation-
# intensive job to "gcc" to avoid renicing after two minutes, since
# gcc is reniced to 19 after just another 18 minutes...
#

#
# Default entry -- moderate renicing, priority always above screen savers.

# Jobs started by the Grid master process always run on 10. If someone
# else besides User grid starts a (fake, presumably) Grid master, kill it
